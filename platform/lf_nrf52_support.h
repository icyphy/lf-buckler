 * - All interrupts are disabled by default after initialization
 * - Priority levels are restricted between (0-7)

// Define PRINTF_TIME and PRINTF_MICROSTEP, which are the printf
// codes (like the d in %d to print an int) for time and microsteps.
// To use these, specify the printf as follows:
//     printf("%" PRINTF_TIME "\n", time_value);
// On most platforms, time is an signed 64-bit number (int64_t) and
// the microstep is an unsigned 32-bit number (uint32_t).
// Sadly, in C, there is no portable to print such numbers using
// printf without getting a warning on some platforms.
// On each platform, the code for printf if given by the macros
// PRId64 and PRIu32 defined in inttypes.h.  Hence, here, we import
// inttypes.h, then define PRINTF_TIME and PRINTF_MICROSTEP.
// If you are targeting a platform that uses some other type
// for time and microsteps, you can simply define
// PRINTF_TIME and PRINTF_MICROSTEP directly in the same file that
// defines the types _instant_t, _interval_t, and _microstep_t.

// format for printing both time and microstep as follows:
//     printf("Tag is " PRINTF_TAG "\n", time_value, microstep);
#define PRINTF_TAG "(%" PRId64 ", %" PRIu32 ")"
