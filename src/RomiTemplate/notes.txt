error_print_and_exit
    -> deprecated
replace with in main.c
lf_print_error_and_exit

how to auto copy headers in src
create lf header system?

loop timer (10msec)
startup

reaction based on loop timer
does this -> interrupt the startup task
    -> no atomic reactions

only works with kobuki serial withiout missed header
must place kobuki init with main loop
    -> research why? help understand problem with simueltaneous logic
        not timing? should be atomic
            no asynchornous or this wouldnt work
    must be about clock initializations
        init the one timer messes with the serial timer?
