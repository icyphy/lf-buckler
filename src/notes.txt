error_print_and_exit
    -> deprecated
replace with in main.c
lf_print_error_and_exit

how to auto copy headers in src
create lf header system?

loop timer (10msec)
startup

reaction based on loop timer
does this -> interrupt the startup task
    -> no atomic reactions

only works with kobuki serial withiout missed header
must place kobuki init with main loop
    -> research why? help understand problem with simueltaneous logic
        not timing? should be atomic
            no asynchornous or this wouldnt work
    must be about clock initializations
        init the one timer messes with the serial timer?


issues
cant use schedule
the issue with error_print_and_exit
    deprecated functions
    

for some reason the make file is not using the schedule.c library
look at make rules
might have to do with internal lf make
    ask marten or shoakai where to look
        or find?
